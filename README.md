# MysQL-DB-For-Testing-Joins
MySQL DB to train with all types of joins : INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL.

## Files in my repository:
- schema_join.sql = the schema file for my DB structure
- data_join.sql = the data file for my DB data loading and join testing
- customers.csv = table customers containing a few rows
- orders.csv = table orders containing a few rows

### Prerequisites
- MySQL or any other compatible RDBMS
- A text editor such as Sublime Text or Notepad++

### To re-created the testdb DB:
Download the schema and data files then run the following command from within your MySQL console:
SOURCE C:<path to your schema.sql>/<your_schema.sql_file>
SOURCE C:<path to your data.sql>/<your_data.sql_file>

# Testing the joins :
Once you have created the test_join database (see steps described in above section), you can run the SQL requests found at the end of the 
data_join.sql file to exercice with the different types of joins.
